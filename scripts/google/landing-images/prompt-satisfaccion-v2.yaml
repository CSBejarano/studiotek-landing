      3D isometric render of a customer satisfaction dashboard interface floating in dark space.
      The main element is a large glassmorphism card showing a circular NPS score gauge at 98 with green accent,
      surrounded by smaller floating glass cards showing: an upward trending satisfaction line chart in blue (#2563EB),
      a row of happy customer emoji indicators, and a bar chart with monthly satisfaction metrics going up.
      Dark charcoal gray glass cards with frosted glass effect and subtle blue neon edge glow (#2563EB).
      Deep black background (#0A0A0A). Isometric perspective view from above-left angle.
      Premium tech aesthetic, modern SaaS dashboard style.
      Soft ambient lighting with blue accent glow reflections on the glass surfaces.
      High detail, professional quality, 3D render style.
      No text labels, no readable words in the interface elements.
